        <h3>Blockquote</h3>
        It was said that:
        <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
            <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
                    Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Inline qutoations</h3>
        <p>The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is <q
                cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
                for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>

        <pre><code>var para = document.querySelector('p');
        
        para.onclick = function() {
          alert('Owww, stop poking me!');

        <p>You shouldn't use presentational elements like <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;center&gt;</code>.</p>

        <p>Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but determined to protect his friends, he raised
            his wand and prepared to do battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and pondering when the next spin off series
            would come out, when an enchanted distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it hasily,
            and lept to his feet; "better get back to work then", he mused.</p>
